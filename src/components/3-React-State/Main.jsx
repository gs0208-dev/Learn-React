/**

 * Let's make a couple new components to make things a
 * little cleaner. (Notice: I'm not suggesting what we
 * have now is bad or wrong. I'm mostly finding an excuse
 * to get in some hands-on practice 🙂)
 * 
 * 1. Move the entire recipe <section> into its own
 *    ClaudeRecipe component
 * 2. Move the list of ingredients <section> into its
 *    own IngredientsList component.
 * 
 * While you're considering how to structure things, consider
 * where state is, think about if it makes sense or not to
 * move it somewhere else, how you'll communicate between
 * the parent/child components, etc.
 * 
 * The app should function as it currently does when you're
 * done, so there will likely be some extra work to be done
 * beyond what I've listed above.

 * Using either the `getRecipeFromChefClaude` function or the  
 * `getRecipeFromMistral` function, make it so that when the user
 * clicks "Get a recipe", the text response from the AI is displayed
 * in the <ClaudeRecipe> component.
 * 
 * For now, just have it render the raw markdown that the AI returns,
 * don't worry about making it look nice yet. (We're going to use a
